### Strings as Objects!

Yes.  They're objects.  Just like turtle.  Here are some methods.  __Let's try them out! &rarr;__

(remember, you call methods on objects themselves)

1. upper() 
2. lower()
3. isdigit()
4. find(s)
5. others - use dir in interactive shell

{% highlight python %}
dir("a string")
help("a string".upper)
{% endhighlight %}
</section>

### The len() Method

Returns the length of a sequence.

{% highlight python %}
print(len("cat"))
# gives 3
{% endhighlight %}
