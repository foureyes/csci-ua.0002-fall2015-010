# PART 1
# -----
# Create a variable called cats and set it equal to the following list:
#
# ['mungo', 'heathcliff', 'riff-raff']
#####


# Create a variable called copy_cats, and set it equal to cats
# ... simply do this: copy_cats = cats
#####


# Using append, add another cat, named 'wordsworth', to copy_cats
#####


# Print out both cats and copy_cats
#####


# Print out a message saying what you observed about the two variables
#####



# PART 2
# -----
# Now... create a new list called numbers, and set it equal to [1, 2, 3]
#####


# Create a function called remove_first. It should take one parameter, my_list.
# It should not return any value.
# It should use del to remove the 1st element of my_list
#####


# Call your remove_first function by passing it your list from above, numbers.
#####


# Print out numbers... and print out a message explaining what happened.
#####



# PART 3
# -----
# Now... try to print out the element at index 100 of your cats list
# (it should give you an error after you run this file)
#####


# MODIFY THE ABOVE CODE with a try/except statement so that you "catch"
# the IndexError in the except clause. Within your except clause, print out
# a message saying: "nope, not here!". Make sure this file is runnable when
# you've completed this last part (that is, the exception is handled by your
# except clause).
