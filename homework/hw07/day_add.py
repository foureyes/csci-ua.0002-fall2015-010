From How to Think Like a Computer Scientist, Chapter 6 Exercises:

http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/fruitful_functions.html#exercises

Write a function that helps answer questions like '"Today is Wednesday. I leave on holiday in 19 days time. What day will that be?"' ...So the function must take a day name and a delta argument — the number of days to add — and should return the resulting day name:

day_add("Monday", 4)   # returns "Friday"
day_add("Tuesday", 0)  # returns "Tuesday"
day_add("Tuesday", 14) # returns "Tuesday"
day_add("Sunday", 100) # returns "Tuesday"

Write assertions to test the above examples.
