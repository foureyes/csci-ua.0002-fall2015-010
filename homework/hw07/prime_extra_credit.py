====
Improve the brute force algorithm that you used in the previous assignment.
For example, you don't have to test all of the numbers between 1 and the
original number.  Some things to try:

* if a number is not even, it can't be prime (it will always also be divisible 
  by 2!)
* stopping at a certain factor - such as the square root

Test your new function!

* use at least 4 assertions to test your improvements
* (make sure to mix prime and composite numbers in your tests)
