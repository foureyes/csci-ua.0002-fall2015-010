"""
distance.py (3 points)
=====
This program will calculate the distance between two points on a 2-dimensional plane.

You'll be using the built-in math module for this exercise.

1. Import the math module 
2. To read a little bit about importing, see chapter 3.1: http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/hello_little_turtles.html (note that, in this case, we would like the math module instead of turtle)
3. Ask the user for 4 values:  x1, y1, x2, y2 (these correspond to the x and y values of two points).
4. Find the formula for distance (you know you've got the right formula if it involves squares and square roots!).
5. Use the values that were entered to calculate distance based on the formula that you found. 
6. Use the sqrt function in the math module (you can call it using the module name, then dot, then the function name).
7. Output the two points as well as the distance.

Example Output (consider text after the ">" user input):

Please enter a value for x1
> 2
Please enter a value for y1
> 1
Please enter a value for x2
> 9
Please enter a value for y2
> 1
The distance between (2, 1) and (9, 1) is 7.0
