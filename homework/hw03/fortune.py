=====
Write a program that generates a random fortune.
You'll be using the random module.

1. Ask the user if they want to see the future.
2. If the answer YES, yes, or Yes, then use the randint function from the random module to generate a random number from 1 up-to and including 4.
3. Create 4 fortunes.
4. Based on the number that is generated, output one of the fortunes that you created.
5. If the answer isn't any of the permutation of "yes" specified above, say "I didn't want to tell you anyway"

Example Output (consider text after the ">" user input):

Run 1:
-----
Would you like to see your future? > YES
You'll have a pastry today.

Run 2:
-----
Would you like to see your future? > yes
There are many quotation marks in your future!

Run 3:
-----
Would you like to see your future? > no
I didn't want to tell you anyway
