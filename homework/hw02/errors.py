In a comment, paste at least one of the run time errors that you stumbled on while writing your code.  Identify what line it (it should be in the error message if it was a run time error) was on and why it happened.

Example:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "temperature.py", line 19, in <module>
    c = float(input("Please enter a temperature in celsius\n> "))
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'fdg'

My error was on line 19.  It was because I was casting to a float, and the user input was not numeric.
