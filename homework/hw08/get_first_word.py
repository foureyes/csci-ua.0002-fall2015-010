=====

Reimplement get_first_word:
http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0002-spring2015-008/classes/17/review.html#32.0

* instead of using a for loop to get the end index of the word (that 
is.... instead of using a for loop to find the first space character)
* use a string method to search for the first space 
* you can find some potential methods to use in pages 354 through 357 of your
  book
* you can also check the slides: 
  http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0002-spring2015-007/classes/17/objects.html
* keep all four assertions that were in the original slides
